ada: 'Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized,
  with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions
  with its internal cryptocurrency, ADA.Cardano was founded in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder
  Charles Hoskinson. The development of the project is overseen and supervised by
  the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland. It is the largest cryptocurrency
  to use a proof-of-stake blockchain, which is seen as a greener alternative to proof-of-work
  protocols.

bnb: "\nBinance coin (BNB) is the exchange token of the Binance crypto exchange. It\
  \ was launched originally on the Ethereum blockchain but later migrated to the Binance\
  \ Smart Chain, now called BNB Chain.\n\nHolders of BNB with Binance accounts can\
  \ access discounted fees on the exchange. That means demand for the token is linked\
  \ to demand for the exchange\u2019s services. Therefore, buying BNB can be seen\
  \ as a bet on the success of the exchange, in a similar way to buying a share in\
  \ a company, except that owning the token comes with no ownership rights in the\
  \ exchange.\n"
btc: "Bitcoin (Abbreviation: BTC; sign: \u20BF) is a decentralized digital currency\
  \ that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions\
  \ are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed\
  \ ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown\
  \ person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began\
  \ use in 2009, when its implementation was released as open-source software.:\u200A\
  ch. 1\u200ABitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel\
  \ Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences recipients.The word bitcoin was defined in\
  \ a white paper published on 31 October 2008. It is a compound of the words bit\
  \ and coin. No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization exists; some sources\
  \ use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin,\
  \ lowercase, for the unit of account. The Wall Street Journal, The Chronicle of\
  \ Higher Education, and the Oxford English Dictionary advocate the use of lowercase\
  \ bitcoin in all cases.\nThe legality of bitcoin varies by region. Nine countries\
  \ have fully banned bitcoin use, while a further fifteen have implicitly banned\
  \ it. A few governments have used bitcoin in some capacity. El Salvador has adopted\
  \ Bitcoin as legal tender, although use by merchants remains low. Ukraine has accepted\
  \ cryptocurrency donations to fund the resistance to the 2022 Russian invasion.\
  \ Iran has used bitcoin to bypass sanctions."
eth: "Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.\
  \ Ether (Abbreviation: ETH;  sign: \u039E) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.\
  \ Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization.Ethereum\
  \ was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum\
  \ included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin. In\
  \ 2014, development work began and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on\
  \ 30 July 2015. Ethereum allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized\
  \ applications onto it, with which users can interact. Decentralized finance (DeFi)\
  \ applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for\
  \ typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as\
  \ allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out\
  \ for interest. Ethereum also allows users to create and exchange NFTs, which are\
  \ unique tokens representing ownership of an associated asset or privilege, as recognized\
  \ by any number of institutions. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies utilize\
  \ the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized\
  \ the platform for initial coin offerings.\nOn 15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned\
  \ its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in an\
  \ upgrade process known as \"the Merge\". Consequently, Ethereum's energy consumption\
  \ rate was reduced by about 99.95%, translating to an estimated 110 TWh of annual\
  \ energy savings (110 billion kilowatt-hours). The upgrade required no actions from\
  \ Ethereum's users. During the Merge, Ethereum's proof-of-work mining mechanism\
  \ was replaced with the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake blockchain network secured\
  \ by validators staking ether.\n\n"

  == History ==

  Solana was proposed in a white paper Anatoly Yakovenko published in November 2017.
  This paper described a technique called "proof of history".On 16 March 2020, Solana''s
  first block was created.In September 2021, Bloomberg journalist Joanna Ossinger
  said investors argued that Solana was "a potential long-term rival for Ethereum",
  citing superior transaction speeds and lower associated costs.On 14 September 2021,
  the Solana blockchain went offline after a surge of transactions caused the network
  to fork, and different validators had different views of the state of the network.
  The network was brought back online the next day on 15 September 2021.On 16 December
  2021, the former First Lady of the United States Melania Trump announced her plans
  to use Solana to launch a non-fungible token (NFT). The Solana Foundation issued
  a press release to clarify that her choice of the platform was not officially "part
  of any Solana-led initiative."The Solana blockchain again went offline on May 1st,
  2022 and May 31st, 2022. The outage at the beginning of the month lasted roughly
  seven hours, and the one at the end of the month lasted about four and a half hours.On
  the 3 August 2022, it was announced that the Solana ecosystem had been targeted
  by hackers, affecting 9,231 Solana wallets. Four Solana wallet addresses took approximately
  $4.1 million in total from victims. All wallets affected were at one point created,
  imported, or used in the Slope wallet applications on iOS and Android.  Security
  researchers discovered that Slope wallet sent sensitive account data to its remote
  servers in clear text.



  === Lawsuit ===

  On July 1, 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against Solana.'
